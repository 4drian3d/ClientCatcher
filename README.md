Simple Velocity plugin to get the client with which a player has connected to your server

The plugin is not fully effective, several malicious clients hide their client branding when entering the server or impersonate vanilla clients. 
However, the plugin can detect several clients such as Forge, Fabric, LiteLoader, Lunar, Vanilla, and others.
